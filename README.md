## üîç Features and Techniques

This project uses only native browser technologies and highlights a few areas of interest:

- [Element selection and traversal](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) using `querySelectorAll`.
- Input validation to prevent duplicate operators or malformed expressions (e.g., division by zero).
- Basic [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) for responsive layout of calculator buttons.
- [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) for theme management.
- [CSS Transitions and Transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions) for UI feedback.
- [Responsive Design with Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_queries) ensures adaptability across devices.
